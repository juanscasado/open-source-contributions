## 🏢 CVS Health
- I implemented several Testaro rules (training and clean‑room), created validator jobs and fixtures, and prepared separate branches/PRs. For example, I wrote the textSem rule: it scans inline presentational elements (i, b, small), checks for visible text content in the page, reports instances via the project’s init/report utilities so the harness produces standard results, and I validated it against the repository fixtures with the Playwright-based test runner. I also added README instructions, ran and fixed validators until all tests passed, and completed the CLA.
